# Meergo Swift SDK (🚧 work in progress)

---

## 🚨 Important note. 🚧 Please note that this SDK is still under development, has not been released, and is therefore not yet usable. Therefore, the commands and documentation provided here may not work or may be changed without notice. Stay tuned for updates. 👀

The Meergo Swift SDK lets you send customer event data from your Apple applications (iOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS, visionOS) to your specified destinations.

## SDK setup requirements

- Set up a Meergo account.
- Set up an Apple source in the dashboard.
- Copy the write key and the endpoint.

## Installation

To integrate the Swift SDK inside your application, add the package dependency to your Xcode project or `Package.swift`. Make sure to replace `<latest_version>` with the latest version of the SDK.

In your `Package.swift`, add the following dependency:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/meergo/analytics-swift", from: "<latest_version>")
]
```

Then add `Meergo` as a dependency of your target:

```swift
.target(
    name: "YourApp",
    dependencies: [
        .product(name: "Meergo", package: "analytics-swift")
    ]
)
```

Or, in Xcode, go to **File → Add Package Dependencies...** and enter the repository URL.

## Using the SDK

```swift
import Meergo

let configuration = Configuration(writeKey: "YOUR_WRITE_KEY")
    .endpoint("YOUR_ENDPOINT")
    .trackApplicationLifecycleEvents(true)
    .flushAt(3)
    .flushInterval(10)
    // ...other config options

let analytics = Analytics(configuration: configuration)

analytics.track(name: "Workout completed", properties: [
    "workout_type": "Cardio",
    "duration_minutes": 45,
    "calories_burned": 380,
    "device": "Smartwatch"
])
```

## Sending events
